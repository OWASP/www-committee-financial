# Introduction

The OWASP Compliance Committee is responsible for receiving and investigating complaints.  The Compliance Committee can be reached by sending an email to [compliance@owasp.org](mailto://compliance@owasp.org).

We accept complaints related to OWASP members, projects, committees, and conferences.  Complaints regarding OWASP Staff should be directed to the OWASP Executive Director.  Complaints regarding the OWASP Executive Director should be directed to the OWASP Board of Directors.  Complaints regarding anyone on the Board of Directors should be directed to the Board of Directors (they handle their own complaints).

# Complaint Process

The complaint process is as follows:

1. File a complaint by sending an email to compliance@owasp.org
2. We acknowledge your complaint and provide next steps (typically a call)
3. We capture your complaint into a document and have you review (call or over email).
4. We interview any witnesses.
5. We interview the party the complaint is against.
6. We write up our final report with our findings and recommendations, then present it to Board of Directors for action.
7. Once the case is handed off to the Board of Directors, it is closed on our side.  It is up to the Board to take action, either our recommendations, or one of their choosing.
